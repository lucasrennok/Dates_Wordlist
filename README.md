# Wordlist With R
I created this repository to understand R syntax and make a wordlist with it.

Don't forget to install the packages first.

## The wordlist
The wordlist will be a set of dates in a interval. The interval will be put by the user.

## References
I used the information of [this](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/writing-data-from-r-to-txt-csv-files-r-base-functions) site to generate the text file.
Take a look on it, this web-site show how to create CSV files too.

I used the information of [this](http://material.curso-r.com/lubridate/) site to manipulate the dates. Take a look on it too, this web-site show a lot of interesting functions.

## R language
Is very good to use this language to organize and analise data. Maybe I will use it more after that. There are a lot of functions to take Data Science "more seriously".
